Let's begin with a gracious thank you for considering to contribute. It is, no doubt, people like you that make what is now BreadPlayer.

# How to's

### How to file a bug report:
_We have added an issue template to better guide you when reporting a bug but here's a concise list of what we expect._

1. First off, don't run off immediately after reporting the bug. It is really annoying when the reporter doesn't respond to questions.
2. If you are reporting via email, please report [here](enkaboot@gmail.com) or [here](support@breadplayer.com).
3. Your bug report heading/subject needs to make sense.
4. Your bug report should contain a definitive summary of what happened, how it happened and what were you expecting.
5. Your bug report needs to contain information about your device and operating system.
6. If you have some additional comments, please add them under the **additional comments** heading in the issue. 

**Thankfully, this has all been templated for you in the issue template to make everyone happy. Just keep in view the first guideline.**

### How to suggest a new feature?

1. All new feature suggestions should be reported in this [issue](https://github.com/theweavrs/BreadPlayer/issues/17). This is where I keep track of all the new feature request and how to handle them.
2. When suggesting a feature, please keep in mind to also explain why and how it fits in BreadPlayer.
3. Don't run off :D

### How to build BreadPlayer?
**[Please read the guidelines for building BreadPlayer here.](https://github.com/theweavrs/BreadPlayer/wiki/How-To-Build-Bread-Player)**

### How to contribute code?
_I do not normally have any problems with new code if it works and I can understand what's happening. And consequently, I do not force things but please keep these guidelines in mind._

1. Your pull request must target only one new feature and only one. Don't put everything in one PR. It messes things up.
2. Your pull request must target an issue. If there is no issue, create one. Again management.
3. Your code needs to be clean and formatted. I welcome comments but they are not required or necessary.
4. That's it. Happy coding.


## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/BreadPlayer).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
